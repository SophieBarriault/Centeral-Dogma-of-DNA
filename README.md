# Centeral-Dogma-of-DNA
This project was originally inspired during my internship at Boston University. The project aims to simulate the central dogma of DNA through Python code. The project is also currently being worked on in order to develop a kid-friendly version, to help more youth easily learn about the DNA replication process.
